LEGALASSIST AI - BACKGROUND JOB SCHEDULING SYSTEM
================================================================================
This module implements the core scheduling logic for the LegalAssist AI 
notification system. It is designed to be resilient, scalable, and 
fault-tolerant by leveraging APScheduler with a persistent database backend.

KEY ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PERSISTENCE LAYER: 
   Unlike standard in-memory schedulers, this system uses SQLAlchemyJobStore.
   This guarantees that even if the server crashes or the application 
   restarts, the schedule is maintained in the 'apscheduler_jobs' table.

2. TIMEZONE-AWARE DISPATCH:
   The system runs an hourly check and calculates the local time for each 
   individual user. Reminders are dispatched only when it's 8:00 AM in the 
   user's specific timezone (e.g., IST, EST, etc.).

3. FAULT TOLERANCE:
   Uses misfire handling and job coalescing to ensure that if the system 
   goes offline, it catches up on missed notifications without flooding 
   the user with duplicate emails or SMS.

DEPLOYMENT MODES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- INTEGRATED MODE: The scheduler runs as a background thread within the main
  Streamlit application (via `get_scheduler()`).
- STANDALONE MODE: The scheduler runs as a dedicated worker process 
  (via `run_worker()`), which is the recommended approach for production.

DESIGN PATTERNS USED:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Singleton Pattern: `get_scheduler()` ensures only one BackgroundScheduler 
   instance is created when running in integrated mode (e.g., Streamlit).
2. Dependency Injection: The database session (`db`) is instantiated 
   within the job, but the notification service is injected from the global scope.
3. Strategy Pattern: The notification logic delegates to 
   `notification_service` which decides between SMS and Email strategies.

TIMEZONE HANDLING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Timezones are a complex domain. We store user preferences as IANA strings
  (e.g., 'America/New_York', 'Asia/Kolkata').
- The `is_reminder_time_for_user` function safely falls back to UTC if a user's
  timezone is invalid or missing.
- By running hourly, we can guarantee that every user will eventually hit 8 AM
  in their local time, exactly once per 24-hour cycle.

    ====================================================================================================
    ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW & SCHEDULING STRATEGY
    ====================================================================================================
    
    This function acts as the core heartbeat for the notification system.
    It relies on an hourly execution trigger to ensure that timezone-based
    notifications are dispatched accurately at the start of each user's day (typically 8 AM).
    
    PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
    -------------------------
    Historically, certain imports (such as `has_notification_been_sent` from `database`) 
    were placed dynamically inside the loop over `upcoming_deadlines`. 
    While localized imports can prevent circular dependencies, placing them inside 
    high-iteration loops introduces significant module resolution overhead.
    
    To alleviate this, we've moved the import to the top of this function.
    This ensures that the `sys.modules` dictionary is only queried once per hourly run,
    rather than O(N) times where N is the number of upcoming deadlines.
    
    PROCESSING WORKFLOW:
    --------------------
    1. Database Initialization: Ensures tables exist.
    2. Data Retrieval: Fetches all deadlines occurring within the next 31 days.
       (We use 31 days to safely capture the 30-day threshold).
    3. Iteration & Filtering:
       a. Computes exact days remaining.
       b. Filters to exact thresholds (30, 10, 3, 1).
       c. Fetches user preferences.
       d. Evaluates timezone match (is it 8 AM?).
       e. Evaluates preference match (is notify_X_days enabled?).
    4. Dispatch: Hands over to `notification_service` which handles channel-specific logic.
    
    SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
    ---------------------------
    - As the user base grows, fetching all deadlines in memory may become a bottleneck.
    - Future iterations should consider paginating the query or pushing the 
      timezone-filtering logic down to the database level (e.g. using Postgres TIMEZONE functions).
      
    ERROR HANDLING:
    ---------------
    - The entire job is wrapped in a broad try-except block to prevent a single failure
      from crashing the scheduler.
    - Errors are logged with full stack traces.
    - The database session is guaranteed to be closed in the finally block.
    
    MONITORING:
    -----------
    - The job logs the total number of reminders sent.
    - This can be hooked up to Datadog, Prometheus, or simple log alerts to ensure
      the job is actually running and sending emails/SMS.

    ============================================================================
    SCHEDULER INITIALIZATION & PERSISTENCE ARCHITECTURE
    ============================================================================
    
    This function is responsible for the bootstrap process of the APScheduler.
    The most significant architectural change here is the move from a volatile,
    RAM-based job store to a durable, database-backed job store using SQLAlchemy.
    
    WHY THIS MIGRATION IS CRITICAL:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. RESILIENCE TO REBOOTS: In containerized environments (like Docker/K8s),
       applications are ephemeral. A restart would wipe out the memory, causing
       the scheduler to "forget" its next run times. With a DB store, the 
       scheduler resumes exactly where it left off.
       
    2. MISFIRE HANDLING: If the application is down when a job was supposed to 
       trigger, the scheduler can detect this "misfire" upon startup by 
       consulting the database. We've configured a 1-hour grace period to 
       ensure these missed tasks are eventually executed.
       
    3. SINGLE-INSTANCE ENFORCEMENT: By setting `max_instances=1`, we ensure 
       that even if a job takes longer than its interval, we don't spawn 
       overlapping tasks, which could lead to duplicate notifications and 
       database race conditions.
    
    PERSISTENCE LAYER CONFIGURATION:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We utilize the `apscheduler_jobs` table (automatically managed by 
    APScheduler) within our primary application database. This ensures that 
    the scheduler's state is backed up alongside our application data.
    
    EXECUTION ENGINE:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a pool size of 20. This is optimized 
    for the I/O-bound nature of our notification system (database queries, 
    SMTP calls, and SMS API requests).
